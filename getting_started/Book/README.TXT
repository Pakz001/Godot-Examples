Jots from the book : GD SCRIPT by Marijo Trkulja

I'm working(or worked) through the book and making examples of what I learn(ed) from it. The book is mostly for using godot with gdscript. Sometimes mods to the project using the gui needs to be done.

Maybe myself and others(you!) who just started with godot can get more familiar with it studying these projects.

Quickstart:
When godot has started :
1)Select 2d scene
2)Save As scene from drop down menu
3)add script to node(right mouse button on node)
4)press F5 and select scene. The one we saved(step 2).
