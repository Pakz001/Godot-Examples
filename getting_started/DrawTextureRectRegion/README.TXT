This example show how to draw a part of a image. This from a atlas or spritesheet. This can be used for inventories and such.

Draw_string is also used.

It seems for now(learn) I need to scale the spritesheet to the actual size it wil end up with. Scaling sprites gets them filtered and this destroys the pixelart style.
