In the years that I programmed games I usually used the random commands for random numbers. During a video by streamer and game designer Gixg17 he started talking about a system he uses called a 'random bag' This is a bag filled with numbers. These numbers in the bag can only be the ones that were put inside it. This means it can for instance contain 2x Decisive damage and 4x regular damage and 6x minor damage and 6x no damage/misses. You pick one from the bag and could remove it from the bag or leave it in. In this example I create a few lines showing how to create a bag using a array and the random commands and how to pick a number from that bag(array)
