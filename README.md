# Godot-Examples
Hoping to fill this repo up with hundreds of projects.

QUICKSTART:
To start coding in Godot. Start a new project. Add a Node2D to the scene. Add a script. 
Press compile and select the scene as that script you saved. You can now code using the script.
Screen size can be set in the config.


Using the Steam version of Godot Version : jan2021
