# Godot-Examples
Hoping to fill this repo up with hundreds of projects.

I started experimenting with creating notes as pdf files. I'm currently placing these in the getting started/pdf folder. Maybe I can try to make them look like books. I wil try to use a lot of images.

QUICKSTART:
To start coding in Godot. Start a new project. Add a Node2D to the scene. Add a script. 
Press compile and select the scene as that script you saved. You can now code using the script.
Screen size can be set in the config.

Here is Godot as a Web App. I have not tested everything I made in it but what I tested worked straight from the browser.
