It took me a couple of hours to get this example working. The documentation and tutorials for are not that good.

In this example a player controlled with cursor keys can be moved inside a tilemap. There is collision with the walls. The tiles are inside a atlas.

I kind of had to add things and delete things so it might be messy.
