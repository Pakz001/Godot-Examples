"Code with Tom"

Here 3 sprites are on the screen. One player, one bullet and one enemy. You control the player and shoot the enemy with the bullets.

edit: I added a visibilitynotifier2d to the bullet scene and linked the exit screen section. In this function in the bullet.gd queue.free()
now removes the bullet from the game when it leaves the screen.
thanks to : CodeNMore on youtube for his tutorials.
