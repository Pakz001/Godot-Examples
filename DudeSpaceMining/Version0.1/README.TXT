This is the start of the project. I used a older project and started building on it. There is some cleaning up to do.

Spaceship with spaceship like controls.
Bullets that can be shot.
Tilemap with collision.
Pickups that move towards the player and then get removed.

bugs:
The pickups sometimes get pushed away...
